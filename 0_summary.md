## cloud service model
### IAAS
Infrastructure as the Service model is more like the virtual machine hosting service, like the traditional IDC business, the cloud service provide (CSP) provide the virtual machine to the company to host their business application, the consolidate the computation resource help their client more effiently utilize the CPU power on the cloud platform, no worry about the hardware and IT operation investment.
IaaS, the infrastructure service for the application, provide the application hardware and basic software support, including the server, networking, storage and OS facility, mostly the service was provided in the virtualized environment, but container service was added recently, the Container as a service also an infrastructure service.
### PAAS
Platform as the service provide more software stack to the busines application, not only the infrstructure, but also the application platform, including the database, integration, sync/async communication backbone, and the application runtime environment, the application framework and the modern application system features( 5's abiliies, reliability, availability, scalability etc), and also provide the operation support system to help the tentant more effective and more efficient to use cloud service to support their business growth.
Now some PaaS framework emerging and adopted by some company, some commerical application platform was introduced to the public cloud service offering, like IBM bluemix, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and RedHat Openshift was indenpentdent to the public cloud serivce provider, they can running in the customer private cloud environment and in the hybird cloud environment.

And serverless computing model was adopted because the microservice mdoel, AWS first introducing the serverless computing model and the service can be billed from daily to hours to seconds, that will help customer more economically to use the public cloud resource.

### SAAS
Software as the service is totally runing by the service provider, customer pay the bill by the on-demand usage model, more and more business application will evolute the SaaS model.
the first SaaS pioneer is the sales force( not sure), now Salesforce.com is the biggest CRM provide in the market, and Microsoft provide office 365 and Dynamics 365, some small SaaS vendor provide their service in the AWS or Azure.
And SaaS model will also change the application integration and serivce oriented arhitecture, more standard service integration model will provided and some communication infrstructure will provide more convienient ways to asynchronous sending and receiving data on the internet.

### modern applicaiton
Internet change our living environment, our business model and communcation model, cloud first and mobile first is the trends to the application development world, build the backend supporting service is not wise and not posibble in the future.
Public cloud solution provider and some infrastructure service provide will introduce innovative solution to their customer, application development will be more easy and more quick.
